# KMeans
# PROJECT TITLE:
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American mall market called as Phonix Mall to findout how many customers are visited to a particular shop.on the basis of this prediction of annual income versus spending score
# DISCLAIMER :
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centroid and spending score from the range 1-100 called as Datanodes of the clusters
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
An American Finance market as per the GDP of 2011'phonixs_trillums mall'as in the first range out of 5.The owner of the mall is wants to be exact which particular shop or products search in different kind of clusters in entire mall
As a Data science engineer predict the futuristics financial market for upcoming GDP range based on number of clusters The client wants atleast top 5 clusters (shops)

# CONCLUSION:
According to the model basis prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster 1 which consists red color is a highest cluster which attach more that 50 Datanodes.
# REFERENCES:
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values.The yellow spots represents centroids which is max to max 3
